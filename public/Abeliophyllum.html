        <p><span>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</span> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, <span>Abeliophyllum distichum</span> Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.</p>
          <p>It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both above and below.

The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm diameter.</p>
